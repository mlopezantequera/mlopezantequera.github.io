Born in Caracas in 1988, I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees in Electrical Engineering in 2009 and 2013 from the University of Málaga (Spain).

During my undergraduate studies I interned at electronics manufacturer [PREMO](http://www.grupopremo.es), where I developed automatic measurement systems for testing the magnetic field of electric coils.

After that, I spent some time at the Department of Civil and Materials engineering at the [Royal Military Academy](https://www.rma.ac.be/en) in Brussels as a research assistant working on simulations of shockwave propagation in soil.

I took a gap year during my MsC to become an intern at the [Human Sensing Lab](http://www.humansensing.cs.cmu.edu) at Carnergie Mellon University, where I developed an interest for computer vision and robotics.
After that I joined the [MAPIR](http://mapir.uma.es) research lab in Málaga where I started working on my PhD in 2013.
Finally, I joined Mapillary for a PhD internship in January 2018 and have been there since.
